To solve these challenges, this project introduces a **dynamic pricing engine** capable of:

- Processing real-time data streams.
- Optimizing prices based on predictive analytics.
- Continuously learning and adapting through reinforcement learning.

   - Supports both batch and streaming pipelines.

2. **Advanced Analytics and Machine Learning**:
   - Demand forecasting using LSTM models.
   - Price elasticity computation using XGBoost.
   - Reinforcement learning for pricing optimization.

3. **Scalable Architecture**:
   - Distributed processing for high-volume data streams.
   - Modular APIs for integration with existing systems.
